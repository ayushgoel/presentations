##Usual flow for Approval/Reimbursements:

###1. Send mail to your manager with CC to some handler in case of reimbursement.
###2. Manager responds to the mail with approval.
###3. The task handler creates a GT with the above two mails.

###4. The GT is assigned to someone in accounts.
###5. Wait for eternity.
###6. Check bank account. Thank god if money transferred or go back to step 5.

###Approvals are not so pesky if manager (approving person) is quick.
###But mails tend to slip through other stuff and then you are required to send reminder mails.

# Why Test?

## Let's start with a story

###1. On August 1, 2012, `Knight Capital` deployed software to a production environment which contained an obsolete function.

###2. The technician forgot to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers.

---

###3. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'.

####Note: Power Peg, RLP and SMARS are irrelevant!

###4. Orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server.

???
So the first 7 servers were sending flawed requests to the eighth server.

###In the first 45 minutes the market was open the Power Peg code received and processed 212 parent orders. As a result SMARS sent millions of child orders into the market resulting in 4 million transactions against 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares.

##$460 million loss in 45 minutes!

####So Why Test?

### Because your code deals with money!

* Take a student
* tell him that he has to write a func f2 based on your f1.
* How does he know, who is writing wrong code?

# Static Testing

* verification and validation
* static testing is the verification part of software testing
* "Did we build the right system?"

* Document reviews
* Walkthroughs
* Inspection
* Feasibility analysis or any other form of analysis to determine if the software is what it should be or not
* Code review

#White Box Testing

###A method of testing software that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality.

#Black Box Testing

#Dependency management

---
class: center, middle

##1. Dummy‚Ä®
##4. Fake‚Ä®
##2. Stub‚Ä®
##3. Mock‚Ä®
##5. Spy

---
class: center, middle

##1. Dummy‚Ä®

???
a placeholder required to pass the unit test.
no calls on dummy

---
class: center, middle

##2. Fake‚Ä®

???
used to simplify a dependency so that unit test can pass easily.
implementations should not be called
can be empty implementations

---
class: center, middle

##3. Stub‚Ä®

???
used to provide indirect inputs
implementations return required objects
think dice with definite result

---
class: center, middle

##4. Mock‚Ä®

???
Indirect Outputs
don‚Äôt return to system
are encapsulated by collaborator
example of this is logging

---
class: center, middle

##5. Spy

???
Instead of setting up behavior expectations, Spy records calls made to the collaborator.
doesn‚Äôt care about the inputs passed to Log
, it just records the Log calls and asserts them
